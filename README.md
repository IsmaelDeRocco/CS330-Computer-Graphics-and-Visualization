How do I approach designing software?

--How I started working on this assignment was breaking down each object into simpler shapes. Each one had multiple different shapes used to create it and by manipulating shapes with transformation code, they could be fit together to make the more complex shape. Unlike other times I took a similar course, each shape was not made by creating hundreds of different vectors. There was a function that called a certain shape into the digital space and that could be manipulated with simple code. This made the scene faster and more efficient. What I would take out of this project would be good coding practice. It’s easier to create a function that can be used over and over to create different outcomes instead of creating a function for single time use. 

How do I approach developing programs?

--To start the development of a program, you first need to get the idea of what you want to make. At times when I started creating programs, I used a simple paper and pencil to get the basic idea of what I wanted to create. Then I would digitalize it and start designing it. Like milestones, a program should be built up in stages. When creating my scene, I started out by focusing on the creation of one object. This helped me learn the code and once I understood how to create one object, it was easy to create another 3 objects in minutes now that I understood the code. By slowly learning and building on one object, it helped create the entire scene. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

--Computer science will help me reach my future goal of being a coder or work in IT. I currently work as an IT professional for my city, and I do love the work I do. I am torn between staying in the IT field or moving into coding as a full-on profession. I have been coding and creating applications for years so I’m confident in my work, but I also like repair and network management. This coding class has advanced my knowledge in coding and will help in the future if I decide to step into the field of coding. I was looking into working at a game design company as well, and this Couse’s material in OpenGL would really help me in that field. There are many options as a computer science major that I could step into once I graduate.
